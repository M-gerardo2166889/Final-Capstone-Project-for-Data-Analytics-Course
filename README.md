Final Capstone Project for Data Analytics – Maricopa County PM2.5 & Poverty Analysis
Overview

This project analyzes two major long-term trends in Maricopa County, Arizona:

PM2.5 Air Quality Levels (2014–2023)

Poverty Rates from the ACS S1701 Dataset (2014–2023)

The goal is to identify relationships, highlight yearly changes, and provide insights using a fully reproducible data pipeline built in Python and visualized with Power BI.

Two Python scripts clean and merge the raw datasets into standardized files. These cleaned datasets are then loaded into a multi-page Power BI report that includes both desktop and mobile views.
